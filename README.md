# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @99RY-Zhao (Zoe Ruoyi Zhao)

Iâ€™m currently working as a **Project Assistant** in AI and Neuroscience, focusing on **unsupervised segmentation of medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions** in relation to **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease**, using histology data.

Worked as a **Project Assistant in Behavioral Neuroscience**. My work primarily involves **AI guided analysis of behavioural phenotypes** in the context of **Parkinson's Disease (PD)** using deep learning tools (Anipose, DeepLabCut, etc.) on markerless animals pose estimation data. 

ðŸ”¬ I completed my **Masterâ€™s thesis** on **Synthesize Brain MRI based on Generative models** mainly using diffusion models.

ðŸŽ“ I hold an **M.Sc. in Machine Learning** from **Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (LTH), Sweden**.  
Relevant coursework includes:
- Medical Image Analysis  
- Computer Vision  
- Machine Learning  
- Artificial Neural Networks
- Modeling and Learning from Data
